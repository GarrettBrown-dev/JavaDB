### JAVA AND MYSQL BASICS

## START DATE: 05/20/2021 MOST RECENT UPDATE: 05/24/2021

## Info

This is my first foray into Java! I'm exploring it in an effort to prep myself for a potential interview, and the job position states Java and MySQL experience is beneficial, so here we are! This project has been both refreshing and infuriating. Refreshing because Java is wonderfully similar to C# when it comes to connecting to MySQL, and I haven't used MySQL in a few months, so I'm glad I still remember a bit! And it let me show my ability to learn a bit about a brand new technology with only a tutorial! But this has also infuriated me because, in my efforts to explore new tech, I looked at Eclipse IDE, and while it's honestly pretty cool, it somehow deleted my repository and I lost my commit history when I began work on the select methods. While it was only 7 commits, it still was a hassle to get the repo back in working order and took me HOURS to figure out the issue. It will be noted that, in the future, when I create new packages in Eclipse, it's better to just put it into a new project to avoid that bug. I have included the schema for the table I built if you're interested!

## Tech Stack

- Java (Yay! New language!)
- MySQL
- MySQL-Connector-Java-8.0.25
- Eclipse IDE: I don't think I'll end up using this after the trouble I had pushing my repos. It's a nice dev environment, but that was a hassle to figure out why my projects weren't being committed, and it's not even a fixable issue.
- VSCode

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- unincluded is the vscode folder, which contained reference to the mysql-connector JAR on my computer.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
